Delaunay Test Files
===================

This repository contains test files used by my Delaunator-based libraries:

- [Constrainautor](https://github.com/kninnug/Constrainautor)
- [containing-triangle](https://github.com/kninnug/containing-triangle-js)
- [TriVis](https://github.com/kninnug/TriVis)

The `loader.mjs` file exports functions for finding and loading the files.
